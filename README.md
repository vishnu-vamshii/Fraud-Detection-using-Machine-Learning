## 📂 Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the [Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud). It contains:
- **284,807 transactions** over two days.
- **31 features** including time, amount, and anonymized PCA components.
- An extremely imbalanced target variable where only 0.172% of transactions are fraudulent.
